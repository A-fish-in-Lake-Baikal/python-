  <blockquote>Life is full of confusing and disordering Particular time,a particular location,Do the arranged thing of ten million time in the brain,Step by step ,the life is hard to avoid delicacy and stiffness No enthusiasm forever,No unexpected happening of surprising and pleasing So,only silently ask myself in mind Next happiness,when will come?
人生的纷纷扰扰,杂杂乱乱,在一个特定的时间,特定的地点,做脑海中安排了千万遍的事,一步一骤,人生难免精致,却也死板,永远没有激情,没有意料之外的惊喜.于是,也只有在心里默默地问：下一班幸福,几点开?
Dark light,just light each other.The responsibility that you and my shoulders take together,the such as one dust covers up.Afraid only afraid the light is suddenly put out in theendless dark night and Countless loneliness
暗黄的灯光,仅仅也只能照射过彼此.你、我肩上共同担当的责任,犹如一片灰尘遮掩.怕只怕灯丝的突然熄灭在这无尽的黑夜.数不尽的孤单
Always insisting.Use iron scoop is too cold; Use porcelain scoop is too weak; A wood scoop,engraved veins safely,engraved sky’s wasteland and glebe’s old.Just as happiness born in the years,not insolent,the every act and move blooms quietly
一直坚持着.用铁勺太冰冷；用瓷勺又太脆弱； 一只只木勺,刻出了纹理安然,刻出了天荒地老.一如岁月中隐忍着的幸福,不张狂,举手投足间悄然绽放
Then the wandering soul wild crane stands still the memory river Listen to whistle play tightly ring slowly,Water rises a ship to go medium long things of the past.Wait for a ship’s person Wait for one and other,But hesitate always should ascend which ship Missed Had to consign the hope to next time,Finally what to wait for until has no boats and ships to come and go,Sunset west .
再孤魂野鹤的伫立记忆河头,听着哨子的紧奏慢响,水涨船行中的悠悠往事.等船的人儿,等了一班又一班,却始终犹豫着该登哪一只.错过的,只好把希望寄托到了下一回,终究等到的是没有船只的过往,日落西头 .Life is full of confusing and disordering Particular time,a particular location,Do the arranged thing of ten million time in the brain,Step by step ,the life is hard to avoid delicacy and stiffness No enthusiasm forever,No unexpected happening of surprising and pleasing So,only silently ask myself in mind Next happiness,when will come?
